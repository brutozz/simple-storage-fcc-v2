This code was written as part of my introduction to the full-blockchain-solidity-course-js course by @PatrickAlphaC

We learned that we can interact from one contract with other contracts, we learned about contract inheritance.
We learned how to deploy contracts from other contracts, we learned how to import contracts and how to override functions using virtual and override.
